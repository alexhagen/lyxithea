### Installation

To install `pym`, all we have to do is install `numpy`, `scipy`, and
`matplotlib`, then download `pym` to our code directory (or wherever, really).
To do this, we can use

```bash

$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install colours
$ cd ~/code
$ git clone https://github.com/alexhagen/lyxithea.git

```

and then, we can use the library within any script by using


```python

```
