Those articles published in open access journals are clearly able to be published through a researchers own website.  Researchers should not hesitate to use this repository/method (`ah_paper`) to self-publish those type of papers.
Articles published in other (subscription) journals are quite another story.  Elsevier quite clearly lays out the legality of posting articles published through their journals, and these general guidelines should apply to most journals.  These allow for two avenues of self-publication:

  -  Preprint
	-  A preprint can be published (with a DOI) link, so long as it has "not be[en] added to or enhanced in any way in order to appear more like, or to substitute for, the final versions of articles." [1]
	-  Thus, we can simply self-publish the second-to-last version of our papers (without applying all of the referee requested changes) and be safe.
  - Accepted Manuscript
	- An accepted manuscript can be shared through a non-commercial personal homepage or blog (what we aim for here), as long as we
		- Link to the DOI
		- Bear a CC-BY-NC-ND licence
		- Follow the above advice for not adding to or appearing more like the published journal article.
